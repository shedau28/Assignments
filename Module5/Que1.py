# Why Django should be used for web-development? Explain how you can create a project in Django?

# Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.


# To create the project:

# Open a command shell (or a terminal window), and make sure you are in your virtual environment.


# Navigate to where you want to store your Django apps (make it somewhere easy to find like inside your Documents folder), and create a folder for your new website (in this case: django_projects). Then change into your newly-created directory:
# mkdir django_projects
# cd django_projects
# Copy to Clipboard



# Create the new project using the django-admin startproject command as shown, and then change into the project folder:
# django-admin startproject locallibrary
# cd locallibrary
